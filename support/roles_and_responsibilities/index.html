<p>What each role does on support and when it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<h2 id="rota">Rota</h2>
<p>The support rota is on <a href="https://gds-paas.pagerduty.com/schedules">Pagerduty</a>.</p>

<p>For in-hours support, one person from the team will be the Support Lead on a weekly basis. For out of hours support, to begin with, we will have one person from the team on call as Support lead, again on a weekly basis. We will also have a second person on call for Escalations.</p>

<p>If you are on in-hours support, add your shift onto the #the-government-paas slack channel description so your colleagues find it easier to see who is on support. If you need to swap shifts, ask your colleagues if they can swap or cover, update Pagerduty <a href="https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202830170-Creating-and-Deleting-Overrides">using an override</a>.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>The broad response times and action that our users expect from us are documented in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/document/d/1FLiKPmM61ikO1MJNo96YpxGaYPUMb8CdAcWPnzBBa0U/edit?usp=sharing">PaaS Support Overview (Gdoc)</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/support.html">Product pages</a>. Please read it so you know what they expect. These expectations are different for in-hours and out of hours support.</p>
<h2 id="in-hours">In-hours</h2>
<p>For in-hours support, if you need to take a break for lunch or essential meetings etc, make sure you tell people ahead of time, and arrange for a colleague to cover for you. All other members of the team are responsible for providing assistance to the support person as needed. If you don’t feel comfortable asking your colleagues, talk to the delivery manager or team lead who can help.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-hours">Out of hours</h2>
<p>For out of hours similar guidelines apply, if you need cover for an hour or two or an evening (e.g. for an appointment, or a family dinner), you need to agree this in advance with a colleague who can cover for you, and <a href="https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202830170-Creating-and-Deleting-Overrides">update Pagerduty using an override</a>.</p>

<p>When we first start out of hours support we’ll be in private beta and have few live services which need OOH. These services know that we are learning about OOH, and will not be as polished as we will be later.</p>

<li>Looking at the issue and telling the initiator that you are doing so (if initiated by a human)</li>
