  <h1 id="responding-to-security-issues">Responding to security issues</h1>
<p>Periodically we will learn of a security issue affecting CloudFoundry or our supporting systems we use, this is the process we follow in order to triage and mitigate the problem.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-learn-of-issues">How we learn of issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated datadog CVE notifications from the <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/category/security/">CloudFoundry security RSS feed</a>. This is implemented with <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> - credentials are in <code>paas-pass</code></li>
<li>Notifications from <a href="https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/">cf-dev</a></li>
<li>Notifications in slack from a team member, the #security channel, or others</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-deal-with-issues">How we deal with issues</h2>
<ol>
<li>The person on support should immediately create a Pivotal story with all the currently known information</li>
<li>If a Zendesk ticket was raised, add the story link to the ticket and close the ticket</li>
<li>The person on support should notify the #paas channel that they are triaging the incident</li>
<li>The person on support should either immediately triage the issue themselves, or request support from team members with appropriate domain knowledge (See: &ldquo;How to triage an issue&rdquo; below)</li>
<li>If the triage outcome is that we must take action the story should be prioritised according to severity by the product manager and played if necessary</li>
<li>If the triage outcome is that we do not need to take any action, the story should be updated with the reasons why and finished as a 0 point story</li>
<li>All PR&rsquo;s related to the security issue are prioritised for review until the issue is fully resolved</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-triage-an-issue">How to triage an issue</h2><h3 id="stemcell-upgrades">Stemcell upgrades</h3>
<p>If the mitigation to the security issue is to upgrade the stemcell, you should
apply the upgraded stemcell to a dev environment as a first step. While you are
waiting for the upgraded stemcell to be applied, the issue can be triaged. If
the upgrade applies successfully, a PR can be raised to upgrade the stemcell. If
it does not apply successfully, we should prioritise the upgrade based on the
severity of the CVE</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<ol>
<li>If possible locate the original CVE report</li>
<li>Identify each component of CF and our supporting systems that is affected by the issue</li>
<li>Confirm we are vulnerable by reproducing the security issue on a suitable environment</li>
<li>Identify what the CVE report says needs to be done to mitigate the issue</li>
<li>If a breach is suspected to have occurred, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/operations/information-assurance">alert Information Assurance (IA) immediately</a> to the issue and provide all required information. IA will undertake all communication with Cabinet Office&rsquo;s Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and any external parties as required.</li>
<li>Identify if there are any other practical ways for us to mitigate the situation, such as disabling features or altering configurations</li>
<li>Identify if the issue is fixed in a newer release of the software we are using</li>
<li>Briefly investigate how difficult the upgrade would be, if needed</li>
<li>Record all this information on the story associated with the issue</li>
</ol>
