## Diagrams

Diagrams are generated by
[blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/blockdiag/index.html) from `.diag` source
files in `diagrams/`.

To regenerate the diagrams:
- run `make` from the root directory
- preview the diagram
- commit the changes to the SVG file

If you've added a new diagram, you'll need to edit `diagrams/Makefile`.
