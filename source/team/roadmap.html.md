# GOV.UK PaaS public roadmap

Our public roadmap is a [GitHub project](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-roadmap/projects/1?fullscreen=true) in the [alphagov/paas-roadmap](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-roadmap/) repository

The roadmap is publicly visible on the internet, and it is intended for tenants and prospective tenants.

Tenants can make feature requests, suggest new services we might broker, and discuss and vote on existing issues. When a tenant makes a request via support, or otherwise expresses an unmet need, we should encourage them to document it in the "Proposed" column of the roadmap.

We review the roadmap every other week. We aim to triage the issues, respond to commenters, retire any issues that aren't useful, and make sure the board reflects reality (i.e. things being worked on are in "Doing")
