# Penalties
There are certain things which can earn you a 'mark'. Not as terrifying or drastic as the dreaded [Black Spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_(Treasure_Island)) created by Robert Louis Stevenson in his novel 'Treasure Island', but nonetheless still part of our team culture.

The penalty, for achieving the most marks for a sprint, is to buy treats/healthy eats for the team retrospective.

The markable offences are listed below.

##Â Late for Standup
Scary. Turning up late for the standup? How could such a thing happen. One Mark.

Missing standup, or being late, means you will miss out on updates on:

* Team News (who is where today)
* Product News (any significant developments worth knowing about)
* Context on Work in Progress

The last one is especially important, as the standup is a valuable way to crowdsource ideas on problems that people may be having with a story, and if you are not there, you can't help.

## Use of Banned words
Diversity is important to us, as is inclusivity. To help create such an atmosphere we avoid the use of certain words. Use any of the words below and you receive One Mark.


### Gender Specific Words
| Gender Specific Words |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| guys | gents | chap | man |
| he | girls | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

There is a great write up on the word [guys by Jessica Evans](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/27/guys-guys-guys/) that helps explain why it isn't quite gender neutral.

Another great reference article [the first rule of devops club by Bridget Kromhout](http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2014/11/03/the-first-rule-of-devops-club/)

### Assumed expertise
| Assumed expertise |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| just | obviously | trivial | &nbsp; |

Whilst obviously these words are just trivial throwaway adjectives on the face of it, the reality is they assume expertise and can act to belittle contributions to a discussion. For example, using the word obviously can be a form of [Hindsight Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias), some people reading this may know it, but others may not. Not so obvious right? 

If this language is used widely it can stop people contributing to discussions. It can make asking questions scary. This is bad.

Another problem with these set of words is that it can lead to underestimation of effort by the team when effort is played down.

### Anti People
| Anti People |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Resource(s) | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

Classic Management 1.0 speak, reducing people to Resources. We should not be doing this.
