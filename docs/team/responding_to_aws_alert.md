# Responding to AWS alerts

AWS now sends alerts to the team mailing list. These include:

- Billing alerts
- Notification that Amazon has detected that an access key is publicly available

The process for responding to these is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytziKl6MUcnN_4QlBYy0c6fm_uykm4T98qoam6SEE-k/edit).
