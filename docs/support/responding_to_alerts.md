Tips for responding to alerts when you are on support.

## Failed logins

In case of security incident, for example when alerted of a brute-force attack by datadog monitors,
it may help to look at UAA logs.

The access logs is on the UAA VMs in `/var/vcap/sys/log/uaa/localhost_access.log`.

All other logs are sent to [logsearch](https://logsearch.cloud.service.gov.uk):

* Scope to component: UAA
* Look for strings like `UserNotFound`, `PrincipalAuthenticationFailure` or `UserAuthenticationFailure`
* `principal=XXX` will give you the username
* `origin=[1.2.3.4]` will give you the origin IP
* `UserAuthenticationSuccess` will give you the successful attempts
  * Google authentication origin will show `sessionId=XXX`
  * non Google authentication origin will show `clientId=cf`
