            <h1 id="networking">Networking</h1>
<p>This page describes the network layout in a single PaaS deployment on AWS.</p>
<h2 id="vpc">VPC</h2>
<p>We use a single <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/">virtual private cloud</a> (VPC), with IP range <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>.</p>

<p>Our VPC is in the <code>eu-west-1</code> region, in Ireland, and includes <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html">subnets</a>
in each of the <code>eu-west-1a</code>, <code>eu-west-1b</code>, and <code>eu-west-1c</code> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html">availability zones</a> (AZs).</p>

<p>Since we run a VPC for each of our CI, Staging and Production environments, and for each developer&rsquo;s environment, we sometimes run into <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_Limits.html">limits</a> on the resources we are allowed to use.
We&rsquo;ve raised various limits by submitting requests to Amazon.
The result (sometimes out of date) is recorded in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZkHASsyROKiixrvpV-ecePMqAj9zPAjQENQlsOh6QBc/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subnets">Subnets</h2>
<p>We have 5 subnets in each AZ.</p>

<p><code>infra</code> handles outbound internet traffic.
It also contains Bosh, Concourse, and the bosh and cf RDS instances.</p>

<p><code>cf</code> contains most Cloud Foundry components.</p>

<p><code>router</code> contains the Router Cloud Foundry component.</p>

<p><code>cell</code> contains the Cell Cloud Foundry component, for deploying tenant apps into.</p>

<p><code>aws-backing-services</code> contains RDS instances dynamically created for tenants by the RDS broker.</p>

<p>We usually speak of an instance being in a subnet. This is not quite accurate, but is a useful shorthand.
Really, each instance has an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ElasticNetworkInterfaces.html">Elastic Network Interface</a> (ENI) which has at least one private IP, among other attributes.
Instances can have more than one ENI, and ENIs can be moved between instances, although an instance&rsquo;s primary ENI can&rsquo;t be removed.</p>

<p>We use a single ENI per instance, each with a single private IP.
So each of our instances will only be in a single subnet.</p>
<h2 id="internet-access">Internet Access</h2><h3 id="gateways">Gateways</h3>
<p>There is a single <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html">Internet Gateway</a> for the entire VPC - it is an abstract service available anywhere that scales automatically.</p>

<p>We deploy a single <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html">NAT Gateway</a> in each AZ.</p>

<p>An Internet Gateway allows outbound and inbound traffic.
NAT Gateways only allow outbound traffic (but permit inbound traffic for outbound connections).</p>

<p>Gateways have to appear in the route table for a subnet for instances to use them.</p>
<h3 id="elastic-ips">Elastic IPs</h3>
<p>We allocate an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#vpc-eips">Elastic IP</a> address (EIP) to each NAT Gateway, and to each of the bosh and concourse EC2 instances.</p>

<p>The NAT Gateways each need an EIP to function.</p>

<p>The bosh and concourse VMs each need an EIP to allow making outbound connections to the internet to download dependencies.
They can&rsquo;t use the NAT Gateways for this because the NAT Gateways don&rsquo;t exist when concourse and bosh are first deployed and may be torn down afterwards in dev environments.</p>
<h3 id="elbs">ELBs</h3>
<p>We allocate several <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html">Classic Elastic Load Balancers</a> (ELBs) to provide load-balanced SSL access to Concourse, logs and metrics, and some CF components.</p>

<p>An ELB has a presence in each AZ, and scales automatically with the traffic volume being balanced.</p>

<p>The scaling is transparent to the external user because each ELB provides a DNS name - IP addresses of additional ELB components are added automatically when the ELB scales.</p>

<p>ELBs also handle TLS termination. See <a href="/architecture_decision_records/ADR007-terminating-tls-at-elbs">ADR 007</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subnet-routing">Subnet Routing</h2>
<p>A subnet is called &lsquo;public&rsquo; if the route table associated with it has a route to an internet gateway.</p>

<p>An instance in a public subnet can talk to the internet if it has a public or elastic IP address.</p>

<p>An instance in a private subnet can talk to the internet if it has a route to a NAT Gateway.
The NAT Gateway would be in a different subnet, since it needs to be in a public subnet to work.</p>

<p>Each subnet has an IP range to determine private IPs for instances within the subnet.</p>
<h3 id="route-tables">Route tables</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html">Route tables</a> consist of a list of rules, each specifying a destination and an IP range.
For traffic to a given IP address, the most specific rule is chosen to determine the destination.</p>

<p>The special destination <code>local</code> routes traffic to any subnets in the VPC.</p>

<p>There is a main route table, which is default for any subnet without its own.
Our main route table only specifies a <code>local</code> route.</p>

<p>The route tables for the <code>cell</code>, <code>cf</code>, and <code>router</code> subnets also route internet traffic to the NAT Gateway for the AZ.</p>

<p>The route table for the <code>infra</code> subnets route internet traffic to the Internet Gateway.
The <code>infra</code> subnets are public, and are where the NAT Gateways are located.</p>

<p>Because the NAT Gateways are in the <code>infra</code> subnets, it isn&rsquo;t possible for VMs in <code>infra</code> to route via the NAT Gateways. A route targeting the NAT Gateway would preclude the NAT Gateway routing that traffic to the Internet Gateway.</p>
<h3 id="routing-on-the-instance">Routing on the instance</h3>
<p>The OS running on a given instance has its own routing table.</p>

<p>This will route all traffic destined for the subnet of the instance via the appropriate interface.</p>

<p>It will also route all traffic that needs to leave the subnet via the reserved IP address of the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing">VPC Router</a> in that subnet.
The route table of the subnet determines where it goes from there.</p>

<p>On <code>cell</code> and <code>councourse</code> instances, the presence of lightweight containers means that the OS route table will contain additional routes for directing tenant traffic.</p>
<h2 id="firewalls">Firewalls</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of virtual firewall provided by AWS: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html">Security Groups</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html">Network ACLs</a>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html#VPC_Security_Comparison">comparison document</a> if you want more details.</p>

<p>We chose to use Security Groups instead of Network ACLs to control traffic.</p>

<p>Security Groups operate at the instance level, while Network ACLs operate at the subnet level.</p>

<p>Security Groups are able to track connections, allowing traffic that would otherwise be blocked to flow so long as it is for a connection that was permitted in the first place.</p>

<p>Network ACLs are not able to deny incoming traffic while allowing responses to outgoing connections, which makes them awkward to use.</p>
